# Callbacks refresher: Assignment

## Brief

- Explore index.html and index.js and try to understand what this code does
- Open your terminal in this directory and run the command `open index.html` - this will open a browser with the html file loaded into it. 
- Open your developer tools and press the buttons to see the code in index.js working. 
- Add functionality to the fourth button. 
- When the fourth button is clicked the user should be able to enter a colour to the prompt box. The background of the whole page should become the colour the user typed to the prompt.
- __You should use processUserInput function with a callback to achieve that.__

Have a look at images/example.gif to see the desired functionality.
